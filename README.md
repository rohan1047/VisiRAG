# VisiRAG

VisiRAG (**Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation**) is a multimodal RAG system that allows users to upload PDFs containing text, tables, and images, and then interactively query the documents. The system retrieves relevant information and generates responses enriched with both text and images, providing a seamless multimodal experience.

The project is split into two main components:

- [`backend.py`](backend.py) – Handles PDF parsing, image extraction, embeddings, vector store creation, and query processing with LangChain and OpenAI.
- [`frontend.py`](frontend.py) – A Streamlit-based user interface for uploading PDFs, chatting with the RAG engine, and viewing inline images in responses.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **PDF ingestion**: Extracts text, tables, and images from PDFs using PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, and pdfminer.
- 🖼 **Image descriptions**: Generates AI-powered descriptions for extracted images (via OpenAI models).
- 🔍 **Semantic search**: Uses HuggingFace embeddings with Chroma vector store for retrieval.
- 🤖 **RAG workflow**: Combines document retrieval with OpenAI’s GPT models for contextual answers.
- 💬 **Conversational memory**: Maintains chat history for context-aware conversations.
- 🎨 **Streamlit UI**: Upload PDFs, ask questions, and view inline images in responses interactively.

## ⚡ Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VisiRAG.git
cd VisiRAG
````

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Install dependencies with **uv**:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

Or, if you don’t want editable mode:

```bash

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Before running, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Streamlit frontend:

```bash
streamlit run frontend.py
```

Steps:

1. Upload a PDF file.
2. Ask natural language questions about the content.
3. View responses with inline text and extracted images.
